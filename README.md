# WoF_Post
Code clean-up and optimization of the NSSL Warn-on-Forecast post processing routines.

# Week 1 Priorities 3/2 to 3/6 (add, modify, contest ANY of the points below!):
1. Generate debug test data. A small data set that can be used to run the entire post processing sequence and produces a known baseline result; plots, .nc files, etc.
2. Identify and catalog redundant code chunks that appear repeated within a .py/.pyc file AND/OR across different files.
3. Identify and catalog database code that holds tables, configurations, dictionaries of options etc.
